# Bank YNAB importer [![Docker Build Statu](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/schurig/ynab-bank-importer.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/schurig/ynab-bank-importer/) [![Docker Build Statu](https://img.shields.io/docker/build/schurig/ynab-bank-importer.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/schurig/ynab-bank-importer/builds/) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/4367cde9c1b522b4bcbe/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/schurig/ynab-bank-importer/maintainability)

This is a ruby script that **pulls your transactions from your banks** and imports them into **You Need A Budget** (YNAB).

**Mission:** A script that can run every 15 minutes on a small and cheap mini-computer at your home (eg. raspberry pi) with an easy configuration and support for most European banks.

**Documentation:**

* [How to setup](https://github.com/schurig/ynab-bank-importer/wiki#ways-to-set-up-the-script)
* [Frequently asked questions (FAQ)](https://github.com/schurig/ynab-bank-importer/wiki/faq)

## Disclaimer

**Using this tool is on your own risk.** I can **not** garantee you that this will work for you. Also I can **not** garantee that it won't up your YNAB data. I highly recommend to start with a new Budget or at least test it with a new one before you use your existing Budget.

---

## Supported banks

* Most German and Austrian banks _(all banks that implement the FinTS standard)_
* BBVA Spain _(private accounts only)_
* N26
* PSD2 Banks via SaltEdge API (tested with German bank: DKB)

**ðŸ’¡ Check out the [configuration guides for the dumpers and banks](https://github.com/schurig/ynab-bank-importer/wiki#supported-dumpers)**.

## Why

YNAB only supports U.S. and Canadian Banks for now.

# Technical details on how it works

The script fetches the transaction information from your bank(s). Then it uses the official YNAB API to create the transactions for you.

The script also includes some additional logic like detecting internal transactions by checking if the account transactions go to or come from is one of the other accounts that you set up in the config _(of course this only works if you have multiple accounts configured)_.

# Known Problems

* Please read the notes in each Dumper _[(see Wiki)](https://github.com/schurig/ynab-bank-importer/wiki#supported-dumpers)_ to understand the limitations
